Groupy
=======

Categorise records into nested groups of values.

Example
=======

Define our groups

  class Food
    property :dish, String

    include Groupy
    groupy :dish do
      group :healthy do
        group :fruit do
          value :apple
          value :orange
        end
        value :rice
      end

      group :unhealthy do
        value :fried_egg
        value :bacon
      end
    end
  end

We can then ask a particular food:

  apple.healthy?
  apple.fruit?
  apple.apple?

And we can scope the class by any of these groups

  Food.apple.count
  Food.fruit.all
  
We also get a magic "all_" method

  Food.all_dishes

You can also tell groupy to add the column name as a suffix

  class Something
    groupy :size, :suffix => true do
      value :small
      value :medium
      value :large
    end
  end

  something.small_size?

Any values will be lowercased and underscored

  class Something
    groupy :type do
      value :SomeClass
      value :"Namespace::KlassName"
    end
  end

  something.some_class?
  something.namespace_klass_name?  
  
B00m!
